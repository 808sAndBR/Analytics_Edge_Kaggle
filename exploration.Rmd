```{r, echo = FALSE}
# setwd("/Users/scottbrenstuhl/Projects/AnalyticsEdge/Analytics_Edge_Kaggle/")

library(caret)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

training <- read.csv("data/train2016.csv", na.strings = "")
testing <- read.csv("data/test2016.csv", na.strings = "")
```


# Exploration
```{r, echo=FALSE}
str(training)

# Commented out to avoid Rmd error
#View(head(training,10))

prop.table(table(complete.cases(training)))

# No overlap in user_ids to exploit 
table(testing$USER_ID %in% training$USER_ID)
```

Very low percent of respondednts answered all questions so I will need to figure out some good impution strategies.


```{r, echo=FALSE}

CART <- rpart(Party ~., data = training)

prp(CART)
```
